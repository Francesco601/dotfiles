# dotfiles

These are some of a Linux user's legendary ***dotiles***.

My current system is Archlinux with Hyprland compositor for Wayland.

The file .bashrc contains some useful Bash functions and automated tasks that I have collected from various places for different purposes.

Hyprland is a tiling window manager designed specifically to work with the Wayland graphical user interface that is gradually replacing X11 in the world of *nix systems.

The main config files for Hyprland are hyprland.conf and hyprpaper.conf

I have included my config files for the EWW (Elkowar's Wacky Widgets) bar but I am not currenrly using it as I have not yet learned to configure it.

I have also included configuration files for the Sway window manager though I prefer Hyprland for asetthetics and conigurability.
