# dotfiles

These are some of my ***dotfiles***. These are always subject to change and may not even look the same next week, 

My current system is Archlinux with Hyprland compositor for Wayland.

Here are some screenshots of my current system on ASUS Laptop with 8GB Ram, Intel Core i5 and about 500GB NVME SSD,

The file .bashrc contains some useful Bash functions and automated tasks that I have collected from various places for different purposes.

Hyprland is a tiling window manager designed specifically to work with the Wayland graphical user interface that is gradually replacing X11 in the world of *nix systems.

The main config files for Hyprland are hyprland.conf and hyprpaper.conf

I have included my config files for the EWW (Elkowar's Wacky Widgets) bar but I am not currenrly using it as I have not yet learned to configure it.

I have also included configuration files for the Sway window manager though I prefer Hyprland for aesthetics and configurability.
